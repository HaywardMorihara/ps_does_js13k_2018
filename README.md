This is a fork of: https://github.com/ooflorent/js13k-boilerplate

> Shoot ’em up with a path drawing “planning” mechanic (i have no good word for this) and an ASCII art aesthetic with VAPORWAVE colors… The player is a process trying to get online, perhaps to reach a lost love on another host or just to be freed from the confines of a single machine…

I highly recommend using this IDE! https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ You can try it out for 30 days, more than enough time for the game jam!

## Process
Let's try to follow these rules so that we may build this game together! We'll all probably break at least one of these rules at least once if we're trying :)

0. Join #ps_does_js13k on Slack
1. Work on anything you want from the issue tracker
2. Create any issue you want in the issue tracker
3. Commit to master whatever you want as long as it is tied to an issue in the issue tracker
4. Have fun!

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
open ./build/index.html # opens game in the browser
```

## Packaging

```bash
npm run package
# share ./build.zip with the world 
```
